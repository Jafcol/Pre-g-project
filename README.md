# Pre-g project

Pre-g purpose is creating a collection of chatbots connected to professional knowledge bases.
These chatbots will provide specific advice like medical diagnosis, entertainment tips, psychological help, nutritional advice etc...
Currently the only assistant deployed is the one connected to the medical database.

The main elements of this project are 3:

1. Assistants created with [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow "Dialogflow"), called "agents"

2. Database-assistant connections, called "webhooks"

3. Android app [Pre-g](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Pre_G "Pre-g") where assistants can provide their service to users

The medical knowledge base is provided by [Priaid](https://apimedic.com/ "Priaid").
